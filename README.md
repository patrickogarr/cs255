The DriverPass project was about designing a new system for a driving school to help students register, schedule lessons, and communicate with instructors. I focused on understanding the client’s needs and creating documents like a Gantt chart and system design plans.

I did well translating the client’s goals into an organized plan. If I could improve one part, I’d spend more time refining the gantt chart with the dmv interface and try to make them more clear to no technical audiences.

I made sure to consider what users needed, which is key in any design project. In the future, I’ll continue using planning tools and user feedback to guide system designs.
